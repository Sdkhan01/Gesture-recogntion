# Spotify Control using Hand Gesture

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to control the Spotify music player using hand gestures captured through a webcam. By using the Mediapipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing, we can detect hand gestures and map them to various Spotify controls, such as play/pause, next track, previous track, and volume control.
